//Undefined is just a placeholder which kept for time been until it is assined a variable
var b = 10


//try to access var that not been created is not defined
// console.log(c)

//JavaScript is weakly type language, meaning it does not attach it's variable to specific data

a = 'Hello';//it takes string
console.log(a);

a = 20;//it takes integers
console.log(a);
